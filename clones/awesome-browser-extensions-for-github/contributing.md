## Contributing

First, thanks for your contribution to the community! Submitting new extensions is easy as opening an Issue. In fact all you have to do is 
[create a new issue](https://github.com/stefanbuck/awesome-browser-extensions-for-github/issues/new?assignees=&labels=submit&template=submit-extension.yml&title=Submit+new+extension). That's it! I'll take it from there. 

If you need to update an existing listing, please follow the formal pull request process.
