Takeaway: “[T]he teams I’ve been on with the strongest culture were those where a concerted effort was made not only to bring new members up to speed with the work, but with the ideas that underlie the work. Without saying so much, we infused them with the mission and vision of the project by spending the time to help them understand why we were doing what we were doing. Making sure that we weren’t just explaining what they would be doing, but why and for whom.”</p></li>

Takeaway: No deployments to production on your first day, but instead identify tools to make an impact. Most onboarding tasks are done solo, but “distracting” team members is okay. Also: All software/devstack setup is manual, so that people will know how to fix it when it breaks; and new hires are encouraged to give constructive feedback about the product.</p></li>

Takeaway: “Ultimately, Toast’s engineering onboarding playbook is comprised of a mixture of background information transmitted through automated systems, coupled with direct in-person trainings. Team leads and onboarding buddies help fill in the gaps to get each and every person acclimated to life at Toast and ready to do their best work. The entire process is systematized and documented, so that everyone knows what to expect, and labor is divided between automated systems and people on the team, so that no one person is overburdened and nothing slips through the cracks.”</p></li>

Takeaway: “Onboarding must be: Repeatable; Self Service; Written Down; In Source Control. Additionally, I believe the key to keep your onboarding documentation alive, accurate, and up to date is this: Every New Hire Must Update The Docs.”</p></li>
