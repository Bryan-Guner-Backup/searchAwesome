# Contribution Guidelines

Please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- Use the following format: `[Question](Answer link)`.
- Use the question text as the link handle.
- The answer should be an actual answer to someone else's question, not a discussion to
  a general question. Ex. [this one](https://github.com/cyberglot/awesome-answers/pull/23) is
  fine because it is an (very long) answer to emails people have sent. 
- Use the link to the answer (not the question). They have share buttons for that.
- Commits should follow the pattern: `add "<question>"`.
- Add only 1 answer per commit.
- Answer additions should be added to the bottom of the relevant category.
- New categories or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome.
- The pull request and commit should have a useful title.
- Review your markdown formatting before sending a Pull Request.
