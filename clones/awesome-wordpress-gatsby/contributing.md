## Broken Link Checking

We added a Github action (post-push) for broken link checking. This means it runs through the README.md to make sure no dead links are used.
If you make a contribution and discover dead links, that have nothing todo with your PR, please let us know, so we can fix it straight away.


## Updating your PR

A lot of times, making a PR adhere to the standards above can be difficult.
If the maintainers notice anything that we'd like changed, we'll ask you to
edit your PR before we merge it. There's no need to open a new PR, just edit
the existing one. If you're not sure how to do that,
[here is a guide](https://github.com/RichardLitt/knowledge/blob/master/github/amending-a-commit-guide.md)
on the different ways you can update your PR so that we can merge it.
