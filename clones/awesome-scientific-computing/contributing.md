Ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- Only awesome is awesome. Only put stuff on the list that you or another
  contributor can personally recommend.
- **If you just created something, wait at least 30 days before submitting.**
  This is to give it some time to mature and ensure it's not just a
  publish-and-forget type of project.
- If you submit a project that is similar to an existing project in the list,
  argue how it's better.
- Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a
  duplicate.
- Suggested packages should be tested and documented.
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
- Use the following format:
  `[package](link) - Description. [language, license, repo]`
- Additions should be added to the bottom of the relevant category.
- Keep descriptions short and simple, but descriptive.
- Start the description with a capital and end with a full stop/period.
- Don't start the description with `A` or `An`.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.
- The pull request should have a useful title and include a link to the package
  and why it should be included.
- New categories or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome,
  but should be done in a separate pull request.

Thank you for your suggestion!
