# Why

In a nutshell, there are many awesome lists in the Awesome :)  
We hope to build an application to access them more quickly.  
That's why "Awesome Search" was born. :octocat:

# Features

✔ Access and search every awesome repo collected in [sindresorhus/awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) in one page quickly.  
✔ Access an awesome repo by `https://awesomelists.top/#repos/sindresorhus/awesome-nodejs`. (you can BOOKMARK it!)  
✔ Categories of an awesome repo are supported if the that repo uses `headings`.  
✔ Use Github API to retrieve README file of an awesome repo, so it's up-to-date.  
✔ Search links in a specified repo we have parsed, see [supported repo](#supported-awesome-lists)

# Supported awesome lists

Currently, searching `links` in most of awesome repositories is supported.
You can see the JSON format of links [here](https://github.com/bgoonz/Awesome.json/blob/master/awesome/awesome.json).(Contribution is welcome)
We build [awesomelists-index](https://github.com/John-Lin/awesomelists-index) to parse these lists. However, we are still finding a more efficient way.
[awesome.json](https://github.com/bgoonz/awesome.json) is the place where the data store for now.
